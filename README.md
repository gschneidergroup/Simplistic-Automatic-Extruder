# Simplistic-Automatic-Extruder
LabVIEW code and drivers as discussed in our paper: "Building a Simplistic Automatic Extruder: Instrument Development Opportunities for the Laboratory"
This is open source work done by the Dr. Gerald Schneider Research group of Louisiana State University. 

Here we present code and drivers for an automatic extruder consisting of two synchronized automatic syringe pumps. This system can be used in teaching laboratories in order to introduce students to topics such as self-assembly. We specifically used and tested the extruder to prepare lipid vesicles as are used in medicine, cosmetics and material sciences. 

Notes from the developer of the project: 

This project provides a user friendly software for full control over two NE-50X syringe pumps working in unison of one another. These LABVIEW programs are particularly designed for automatic extrusion of liposomes. The subVIs are within the driver folder, within the NE-50X driver.

Be sure to be aware of the port connections from the pump to the computer, and set them according on the right of the user interface of the LABVIEW software. Follow the pump's instruction manual for basic setup of primary and secondary individualized pump setup.
